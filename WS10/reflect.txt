- Function Template: 
A template in C++ allows you to write generic code that works with different 
data types specified by the client. It uses angle brackets (< >) to enclose 
the type parameter definitions. The typename or class keyword is used to 
identify type placeholders. Templates enable you to create reusable functions 
and classes that adapt to various data types without duplicating code.


- Class Template
- Constrained Casts:
Constrained casts in C++ are vital for maintaining type safety. Using keywords 
like static_cast, reinterpret_cast, const_cast, and dynamic_cast, developers 
can safely convert between different types while avoiding ambiguity and 
bypassing the type system's safeguards. It is recommended to use casts 
judiciously and localize them to specific contexts when absolutely necessary.
