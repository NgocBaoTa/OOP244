- Function bindings: The binding of a member function can take either of two forms:
    + early binding - based on the object's static type
	Early binding occurs at compile time and is the most efficient binding of a 
member function call to that function's definition.  Early binding is the default in 
C++.
    + dynamic dispatch - based on the object's dynamic type
	Some programmers include the qualifier virtual in derived class declarations 
as a form of documentation.  This improves readability but has no syntactic effect.  

- Pure virtual function: 
The principal component of an abstract base class is a pure virtual member function.  
Pure refers to the lack of any implementation detail.  That is, a pure virtual 
function is a signature without a definition. 

- Abstrct classes: The definition of any abstract base class contains or inherits at 
least one pure virtual member function.  The class definition contains the declaration 
of the pure virtual function.  We call an abstract base class without any data members 
a pure interface.
