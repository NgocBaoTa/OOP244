- Deep copies and assignments
	+ Copy constructor: A copy constructor is a special member function 
in object-oriented programming that allows creating a new object by copying 
the values of an existing object. It is used in various scenarios, such as 
object initialization, passing by value, or returning by value. The copy 
constructor ensures proper object copying and plays a crucial role when 
dealing with dynamic memory allocation.
	+ Copy assignment operator is responsible for copying data from one 
existing object to another. It checks for self-assignment, performs a shallow 
copy of non-resource variables, deallocates previous resources, allocates new 
memory, and copies the data. It ensures proper transfer of data between objects.

- File I/O: 
  + std::ifstream (to create a file object for reading)
  + std::ofstream (to create a file object for writing)
  + The is_open() member function called on a file object returns the current 
state of the object's connection to a file:
