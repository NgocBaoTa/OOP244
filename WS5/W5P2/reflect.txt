- Overloading operators enables redefining the behavior of operators for
class objects:  
	+ Member operators are defined within the class and have direct access 
to the class's representation, 	allowing them to manipulate private members. 
(using operator keyword)
	+ Helper operators support the class but don't have direct access to 
its representation. They are separate functions that obtain information from 
public member functions and don't require access to private members.

- Helper function: obtains all of its information from the public member 
functions of the class that it supports but does not require access to the 
private members of its class.

- Friendship: grants helper functions access (read and write access) to the 
private members of a class (using friend keyword). This allows them to work 
with the internal data of a class while maintaining encapsulation.
