- Class privacy: Any member function can access any private member of its class. 
Different objects share the same code for the member functions but use different 
instance variables.

- Constructor and Deconstructor:
	+ Constructor: Constructors are called automatically when the object gets 
created. An object can have multiple constructors. 
	+ Destructors are also special member functions that are automatically 
called when an object is destroyed or go out of scope. An object just has one 
deconstructor.

- Current Object: The keyword this returns the address of the current object, 
*this refers to the current object itself
