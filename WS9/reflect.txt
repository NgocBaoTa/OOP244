Copy constructor:
The copy constructor of a derived class calls a constructor of the base class.  
By default, that constructor is the no-argument constructor.
But we can override this by calling the base class constructor of our choice.  

Copy assignment operator:
By default, the derived class's copy assignment operator calls the base class's 
copy assignment operator. However, when a custom copy assignment operator is 
present in the derived class, it no longer calls the base class's copy assignment 
operator automatically. In such cases, an explicit call to the base class's copy 
assignment operator is required within the body of the derived class's custom 
copy assignment operator.


Direct call copy constructor: the assignment operator copies the base class part 
of the object and any call to the base class copy constructor is redundant.
