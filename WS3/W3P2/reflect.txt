Member functions are functions defined within a class that provide the interface 
for interacting with objects of that class. They can be categorized as queries, 
modifiers, or special functions. 

Privacy in C++ is achieved through the use of "private" and "public" keywords. 
By default, all members of a struct are public and all members of a class are 
private. By declaring members as "private," their accessibility is restricted to 
within the class itself. Private members cannot be accessed directly from outside 
the class but can be accessed indirectly through public member functions, thereby 
enforcing encapsulation and information hiding.

Input and output: The iostream type that represents the standard input and output 
objects. 
+ cin: It is responsible for extracting a series of characters from the standard 
input stream. These characters are then converted into a specified type and stored 
in the system's memory for further use.
+ cout: It facilitates the transfer of data from the computer's memory to an output 
destination by converting the stored data into a sequence of characters.
