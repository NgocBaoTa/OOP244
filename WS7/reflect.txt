Derived and Base Classes
 
- The derived class: the child in an is-a-kind-of relationship - lower in 
the hierarchy
- The base class: the parent in the relationship - higher in the hierarchy
- The derived class inherits the entire structure of its base class. 
(instance variables, normal member functions, but not inherit base class's 
special functions: constructors, destructors or assignment operators)

- Access: 
    private - bars all access
    protected - limits access to derived classes only
    public - unlimited access

- Constructors are not inherited by derived class but execute in order from 
the base class to the derived class
- Destructors are not inherited by derived class but execute in order from 
the derived class to the base class
